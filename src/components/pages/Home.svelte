<p>Hi! This website is made for people to track their bugs and vulnerabilities in their programs!</p>
<p>This project is <b>open-source</b> so you can view it on my <a href="https://github.com/tomek7667/BugTracker">github page</a>.</p>
<p>The main reason for it, is for me to learn <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> framework and of course to track my bugs!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy using it and that it will be intuitive enough for you.</p>
<p>Have a nice day! :)</p>
